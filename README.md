# Restriction-Site-Positions
I was given generate_site_positions.py, which took a genome fasta file and asked you to select one of four restriction enzymes as input and returned the locations in the genome where that restriction enzyme was cut.
I was asked to modify it to be a able to take multiple sequences as input, and be able to parse ambiguous bases (https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html), and return all of the positions in the genome that would be cut.
